Description: Provides support for rendering a small subset of static 'HTML' and 'CSS' to an
    R graphics device. Conversion from 'Markdown' to 'HTML' is also supported. The rendering
    library is entirely written in Rust, and it is built on top of the experimental project
    Victor by Simon Sapin.
